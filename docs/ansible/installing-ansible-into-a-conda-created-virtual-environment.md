## IMPORTANT

Installing into a Conda environment may require some manual tweaking in order to allow all Ansible modules to work.

### Install via anaconda channel

```
conda create --name ansible -c kbroughton ansible=2.0.0.2
source activate ansible
```

### Install using miniconda and pip

Before creating your Ansible environment you might want to determine which versions of Ansible are available for installation using `pip`.

#### Install yolk3k

```shell
pip install yolk3k
yolk -V ansible
```

### list currently available versions of Ansible via pip

Running the following `yolk3k` command will give you a list of all of the installable versions of Ansible available to `pip`:

```shell
yolk -V ansible
```

Output example

```shell
ansible 2.4.1.0
ansible 2.4.0.0
ansible 2.3.2.0
ansible 2.3.1.0
ansible 2.3.0.0
ansible 2.2.3.0	# ansible-galaxy: error: no such option: --role-skeleton
ansible 2.2.2.0	# ansible-galaxy: error: no such option: --role-skeleton
ansible 2.2.1.0 # ansible-galaxy: error: no such option: --role-skeleton
ansible 2.2.0.0 # ansible-galaxy: error: no such option: --role-skeleton
ansible 2.1.6.0
ansible 2.1.5.0
ansible 2.1.4.0
ansible 2.1.3.0
ansible 2.1.2.0
ansible 2.1.1.0
ansible 2.1.0.0
ansible 2.0.2.0
ansible 2.0.1.0
ansible 2.0.0.2
ansible 2.0.0.1
ansible 1.9.6
ansible 1.9.5
ansible 1.9.4
```

Make a note of the version you want to install

### Ensure miniconda is installed

Try updating conda. If the command runs you are good to go otherwise [install miniconda](../miniconda/installing-miniconda.md).

```shell
conda update conda
```

### Ensure for a virtual environment

Here we create a virtual environment called **ansible-2.3** that will include python2.x

```shell
conda create -y -n ansible-2.3 python=2
```

### activate the target virtual environment

```shell
source activate ansible-2.3
```

### Confirm active virtual environment

Confirm that the environment is active by verifying that the virtual environment name is prepended to your command prompt as follows:

```shell
(ansible-2.3) cjs@automa:~/projects$ 
```

Alternativly you can use the commend `which python` and confirm that the path returned is located in your target virtual environment:

```shell
/home/cjs/miniconda2/envs/ansible-2.3/bin/python
```

### Install the latest iteration of your target ansible version

If you want ansible 2.3 you probably the latest revision, 2.3.2.0. The following will install ansible as well as any dependancies.

```shell
pip install 'ansible==2.3.2.0' 
```

Installation confirmation

```shell
which ansible
```

Output example

```shell
/home/cjs/miniconda2/envs/ansible-2.3/bin/ansible
```

Version confirmation

```shell
ansible --version
```

Output example

```shell
ansible 2.3.2.0
  config file = 
  configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
```

That's it...
